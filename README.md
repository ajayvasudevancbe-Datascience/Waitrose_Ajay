# Waitrose_Ajay
Data Engineering Project 
This project is focused on on data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python. In this lab, you import the pandas library and load a dataset (from the Waitrose folder), then explore the dataset using functions like `df.info()`, `df.head()`, and `df.tail()` to understand its structure. You clean the data by removing duplicates and creating a custom function to fix and standardize the `item-price` column. After correcting price values, you perform grouping and descriptive statistical analysis based on product categories using `groupby()` and `describe()`. Finally, you prepare the summarized data for visualization by renaming columns and using plotting libraries such as `lets_plot` and `numpy` to generate graphical representations. Overall, the notebook demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, transformation, statistical summarization, and basic visualization in Python.
